# TODO

.lit-review

- fill in notes table [4] 

.general

- fix citations: where citation is already in parenthesis, year shouldn't be [0.5]

- include measure of shear [0.5]

.cumulants

- Select only central part of cumulant by using scikit-image [2]

- add to coherence length plot: radiative tracer, condensate and buoyancy [2]

- Discuss similarity of rad. tracer to other fields: likely to similar to
  moisture because of low bowen ratio, condensate elongated with shear and
  similar to buoyant structures? [1]

- add to w scale point about decelleration: so reducing size in CIN layer, but
  coherent structure with rad tracer still wide (if this is true) [1]

- add cumulant cross-sections of potential temperature and water vapour: with
  this explain why potential temperature goes to infinity near surface [2]

.objects

..general

- add details on object splitting method, col parameter [2]

- appendix on crofton's formula [2]

..new

- add plume vs thermal plot and discussion [2]

- add object orientation method, plots and discussion [3]

- add length-scale distribution plots: discuss that length-scales follow
  exponential distributions [3]

..fp-plot

- add vertical planar structures to fp plot: create PDF version with despined
  axis [3]

- include more timesteps, colour by equivalent radius and remove contours [2]: as
  it's not clear that what size of objects are important contour of density may
  not be appropriate as there are many more small objects

.discussion

- discuss profiles of cumulant scales [1]

- discuss fp plot indications with and without shear [0.5]

- compare and contrast cumulant and object-based analysis [2]

- summarise new insight in objects and implications for modelling and
  parameterisation [1]
